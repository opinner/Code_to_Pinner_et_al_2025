# Analysis code to: Pinner et al., 2024

This is the analysis code for the publication  
**Pinner et al., 2024**, *Internal-wave-induced dissipation rates in the Weddell Sea Bottom Water gravity current*  

The figures created here can differ from the published versions, as some post-processing (adjustements and labeling) were made with *Inkscape*. 

Currently the paper is in open peer-review, so this repository can still change. Comments or corrections can be given as issues, discussions or as a community reviewer on EGUsphere.
